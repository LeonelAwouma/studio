## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant cyan (#42C2F5) to reflect a futuristic and tech-oriented feel. It's bright without being too distracting.
- Background color: A very dark desaturated cyan (#0A2A3A) creates a sophisticated, modern dark theme, at around 15% saturation and very low brightness for contrast.
- Accent color: A shade of blue (#4280F5), 30 degrees away from the primary color and with slightly reduced brightness, will highlight calls to action and interactive elements, ensuring they stand out without clashing.
- Body text and headlines: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalistic line icons to represent skills, technologies, and contact information.
- Implement a responsive design with clear section spacing to ensure optimal viewing experience across devices.
- Incorporate smooth scroll animations and subtle hover effects to create an engaging and interactive user experience.
